            <h3>Welcome to the Music Theory Manual!</h3>
            <p>Often when we set out to learn a new field or become better acquainted in one we have spent time learning, it can be difficult to figure where to start, especially if you set out to teach it yourself. Music theory is a fantastic example of this as, even if you have been playing for a long time, developing clear understanding and being able to incorporate it into your day to day activities. Music Theory Manual rectifies this problem by providing core basic information in an easy to understand structure. By covering only essential concepts relating to the topics of notation, rhythm, intervals, scales and chords, our aim is to instill anyone who uses our site with a solid foundation of understanding that will allow for the ability to effectively communicate using the provided topics and easier expansion of knowledge later on.</p>
            <p>In addition to the information freely provided to you, you can also use it as a study app! By simply creating an account, you will be given access to a profile page with a note taking feature. As long as you are logged in you can have the ability to create study notes, give yourself goals, track topics you wish to revise or focus on, and whatever else you can think of. This feature was included to assist in the learning process as a way to keep yourself on track while providing enough flexibility so you can use it in your own unique way.</p>
