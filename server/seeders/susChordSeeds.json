Because of this, while it is made of stable intervals when compared to the starting note, the difference between the fourth and the fifth creates a greater amount of dissonance compared to a major chord.",

Because of this, the dissonance that is created by the substituted note is even more apparent than it is in the suspended fourth chord because the dissonant interval exists in relation to the root note.",
