Because these notes are very close together and the ratio is so large, the interval has quite an abrasive and unstable sound, even when compared to other minor intervals.",

Despite the fact that it is still technically more dissonant than its major counterpart, the fact that they have such similar high ratios can make them tougher to distinguish and more interchangable than other intervals.",
