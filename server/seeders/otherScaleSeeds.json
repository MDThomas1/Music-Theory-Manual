        "description": "The blues scale is a six note variation of the minor pentatonic scale that includes the tritone played inbetween the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth. Because of this addition, the blues scale has a brighter quality than the minor pentatonic scale due to the added dissonance, which can be used for more colorful songwriting but doesn't really allow for creating harmony in a song.",

        "description": "The harmonic minor scale is best thought of as a variation of the natural minor scale where the seventh scale degree is raised a semitone, creating a distance of three semitone between the sixth and seventh scale degrees. Because of this change, like with the tritone in the blues scale, there's a brighter sound created that can open many different angle to approach to harmonic content of a piece of music.",
